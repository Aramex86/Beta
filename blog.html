                    <h3>Sexually transmitted infection</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sexually transmitted infections (STI), also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or venereal diseases (VD), are infections that are commonly spread by sexual activity, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex and oral sex.[1][5] Many times STIs initially do not cause symptoms.[1] This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others.[6][7] Symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain.[1] STIs can be transmitted to an infant before or during childbirth and may result in poor outcomes for the baby.[1][8] Some STIs may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant.[1]
                        More than 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites can be transmitted through sexual activity.[1] Bacterial STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.[1] Viral STIs include genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, and genital warts.[1] Parasitic STIs include trichomoniasis.[1] While usually spread by sex, some STIs can be spread by non-sexual contact with donor tissue, blood, breastfeeding, or during childbirth.[1] STI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the developed world, but this is often not the case in the developing world.[1]
                        The most effective way of preventing STIs is by not having sex.[2] Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV.[2] Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having a smaller number of sexual partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk.[1][2] Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections.[1] During school, comprehensive sex education may also be useful.[9] Most STIs are treatable or curable.[1] Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable.[1] Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.[10]
                        In 2015, about 1.1 billion people had STIs other than HIV/AIDS.[3] About 500 million were infected with either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis.[1] At least an additional 530 million people have genital herpes and 290 million women have human papillomavirus.[1] STIs other than HIV resulted in 108,000 deaths in 2015.[4] In the United States there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010.[11] Historical documentation of STIs date back to at least the Ebers papyrus around 1550 BC and the Old Testament.[12] There is often shame and stigma associated with these infections.[1] The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease, as it includes those who do not have symptomatic disease.[13]

                        test, are often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work.
                        Blood tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states,
                        such as disease, mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function.
                        Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count.
                        Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse.
                        In some of the United States, a blood test is required before marriage.

                        Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article
                        describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting
                        tobacco plants, and the discovery of the tobacco
                        mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898,[2] about 5,000
                        virus species have been described in detail,[3] although there
                        are millions of types.[4] Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem
                        on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.[5][6]
                        The study of viruses is known as virology, a sub-speciality
                        of microbiology.

                    <h3>Flu season</h3>
                    <p>
                        Three virus families, Influenzavirus A, B, and C are the main infective agents that cause influenza.
                        During periods of cooler temperature, influenza cases increase roughly tenfold or more.
                        Despite higher incidence of manifestations of the flu during the season, the viruses are
                        actually transmitted throughout populations all year round.
                        Each annual flu season is normally associated with a major influenzavirus subtype. The associated subtype changes each year, due to development of immunological resistance to a previous year's strain (through exposure and vaccinations), and mutational changes in previously dormant viruses strains.
                        The exact mechanism behind the seasonal nature of influenza outbreaks is unknown. Some proposed explanations are:
                        People are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person.
                        A seasonal decline in the amount of ultraviolet radiation may reduce the likelihood of the virus being damaged or killed by direct radiation damage or indirect effects (i. e. ozone concentration) increasing the probability of infection.
                        Cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucous membranes, preventing the body from effectively defending against respiratory virus infections.[2][3][4]
                        Viruses are preserved in colder temperatures due to slower decomposition, so they linger longer on exposed surfaces (doorknobs, countertops, etc.).
                        In nations where children do not go to school in the summer, there is a more pronounced beginning to flu season, coinciding with the start of public school. It is thought that the day care environment is perfect for the spread of illness.

                    <h3>Medical devices</h3>
                    <p>
                        A medical device is any apparatus, appliance, software, material,
                        or other article—whether used alone or in combination, including the
                        software intended by its manufacturer to be used specifically for
                        diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes and necessary for its proper application—intended by the manufacturer to
                        be used for human beings for the purpose of:
                        Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation of disease;
                        Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation, or compensation for an injury or handicap;
                        Investigation, replacement, or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process;
                        Control of conception; and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means
                        Medical devices vary according to their intended use and indications. Examples range from simple devices such as tongue depressors, medical thermometers, and disposable gloves to advanced devices such as computers which assist in the conduct of medical testing, implants, and prostheses. Items as intricate as housings for cochlear implants are manufactured through the deep drawn and shallow drawn manufacturing processes. The design of medical devices constitutes a major segment of the field of biomedical engineering.
                        The global medical device market reached roughly $209 billion in 2006.[1]
